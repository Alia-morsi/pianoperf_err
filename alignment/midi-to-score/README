to run process_midi on example scores and performances:
1. Download and compile the alignment tool by Eita Nakamura
2. run process_midi from inside that folder.
3. currently process_midi would only run a predetermined score file (hard coded in the script), that needs to be present in the AlignmentTool directory. It would align all performances of that score present in input_dir to it. 
4. do not add the suffixes to either the score names or the performance names, otherwise the script gets lost.
